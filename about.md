I'm an Engineering Manager in Providence, RI. I work at [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com).

I like music 🎧 and I'm a plant person 🪴. I'm constantly trying to perfect my espresso technique ☕️ and I make a mean aviation cocktail 🍸.

I like to tinker and build things in my spare time. You can find all of my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/mike-douglas).
